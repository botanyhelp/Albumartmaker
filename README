Python program to read text and create a 300x300 image file of the text. 

Album art are those things you see on the ipod when playing a song.  Its 
part of the ID3 tag system of mp3 files.  Circa 2010 ipods displayed 300x300 
png files nicely.  This program only makes the 300x300 image file.  The 
text to be put into the image (and many other details) are hardcoded into 
the program.  It would be most useful with many MP3 files where you know 
the text you want to put into the image.  If your MP3 has six songs in it 
and you want to make an image with 6 artist/album/song listings, then this 
program can do it.  Notice that this program will only create the image file. 
You'll need another program to push it into your existing MP3 file's tag. 

You can test it like this:

python piller2.py

...and you will have a new PNG file in the current directory:

test.png

Requires modules Image, ImageDraw, and texwrap
Will use ImageFont if you have them (/usr/share/fonts/bitstream-vera/Vera.ttf)
